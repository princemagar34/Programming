#TEACHER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

ðŸ“Œ About This Project

Developed a comprehensive Java Swing GUI application for educational staff management with separate interfaces for lecturers and tutors, implementing object-oriented programming principles and dynamic data management capabilities.


##Technologies Used:

Development Environment: BlueJ IDE (Java Development Kit)
Programming Language: Java with Swing Framework
Documentation Tools: Microsoft Word, Draw.io for UML diagrams
Design Pattern: MVC Architecture with ActionListener implementation

##Key Components Developed:

TeacherGUI Class: Main controller implementing ActionListener interface with ArrayList for Teacher object storage and centralized event handling system.
Multi-Frame Architecture: Separate GUI frames for main menu navigation, lecturer data entry, tutor management, and specialized operations with consistent design patterns.
Data Management System: Dynamic ArrayList-based storage for Teacher objects with add, remove, display, and update operations supporting real-time data manipulation.
Specialized Functionality: Grade assignment system for lecturers and salary/performance management system for tutors with input validation and error handling.
Interactive Elements: Comprehensive button system with 12+ interactive elements including Add, Clear, Display, Remove, Grade, and navigation controls.

##Core Functionality:

Teacher Registration: Complete data entry forms for teacher ID, name, address, working hours, department, and years of experience.
Role-Specific Management: Separate workflows for lecturer grading assignments and tutor salary/performance tracking.
Data Validation: Input verification and error handling with user-friendly error messages.
Dynamic Navigation: Seamless frame transitions with back buttons and menu navigation.
Real-time Updates: Immediate reflection of data changes across all interface components.

##PROJECT OUTCOMES
